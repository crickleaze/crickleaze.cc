    "text": "I am Ian Green and this is my work website. I am an independent consultant offering hands-on, in-depth, non-generic analysis of the use of data science and technology in complex environments. I am also an advisor to Adaptive, the real-time trading experts.\n\nOutside of financial services, I run the crickles website, which offers insights to athletes through algorithmic analysis of their heart rate data during exercise. I am also an academic partner to Warwick University where I have supervised postgraduate students on data-rich projects in the field of endurance exercise.\n\nIn my career I’ve held numerous roles centred on the mathematics and technology of trading and risk management. I’ve worked on both sides of the fence: as a designer and provider of software, and running substantial trading books that use fully automated routines for pricing and risk management.\n\nI’ve worked for software companies that are very small and very large. My longest period of employment was at Credit Suisse where I headed up global electronic FX trading for several years. Before/after that, I ran a couple of IT departments, then a high frequency trading book and, after the eFX years, finally served as global head of eCommerce for Fixed Income, Currencies and Commodities."
