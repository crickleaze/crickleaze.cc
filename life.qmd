Most of the books that I've read this century are listed [here](https://crickles-public.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/books.html "Ian's book list").

Here's where I've been walking and cycling recently:

```{r}
#| echo: false
source('map_utilities.R')
readRDS("recent_2.rds") -> recent
library(leaflet)
map_polylines(recent)
```
